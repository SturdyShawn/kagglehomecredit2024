# Kaggle Home Credit - Credit Risk Model Stability

Solution for the [Home Credit 2024 Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-credit-risk-model-stability).

Solution write-up can be found in [Solution.md](https://github.com/evgeniavolkova/kagglehomecredit2024/blob/master/Solution.md).

## Usage
Example usage is in notebooks/main.ipynb. To be able to run the code on Google Colab, you'll need to
1. Add data files into data/parquet_files folder.
2. Set paths in [homecredit/config.py](https://github.com/evgeniavolkova/kagglehomecredit2024/blob/master/homecredit/config.py).
3. Create a [WandB](https://wandb.ai/home) account and paste API key on request.
4. About 50GB of RAM to train models (could be less depending on the number of features).

## Project Structure

- data/: Contains all data files (omitted in the repo because of the size).
    - csv_files/: CSV files [provided by the host](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-credit-risk-model-stability/data).
    - parquet/: parquet files [provided by the host](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-credit-risk-model-stability/data).
    - processed/: Processed data files generated via data processors from [data/](https://github.com/evgeniavolkova/kagglehomecredit2024/tree/master/homecredit/data).
- features/: Contains all feature-related files.
    - feature_definitions.csv: Definitions and descriptions of each feature, provided by the host.
    - features_X.csv: CSV files containing information about how to transform and aggregate features. Manually created. X is a version of the data processor.
    - dfs_props_X.pkl: Information files about data files and features, each one is generated by [scripts/write_props.py](https://github.com/evgeniavolkova/kagglehomecredit2024/blob/master/scripts/write_props.py).
    - featuresX.txt: Text files containing features to include in each processor. Generated manually after feature selection.
